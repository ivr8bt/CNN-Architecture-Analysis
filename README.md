# CNN-Architecture-Analysis

I analyze the LeNet5, VGG16, InceptionV3 and ResNet50 architectures on 4 different datasets: Cifar10, Cats vs. Dogs Redux: Kernel addition, Eurosat and Horses vs. Humans. Each of these datasets involve different kinds of comparison. 2 are multiclass and 2 are binary classification problems. The datasets also have different image sizes and numbers of images. I found that VGG16 and InnceptionV3 performed the best across all 4 datasets. InceptionV3 was overall the best since it had comparable accuracy to VGG16 with an average accuracy of 86% across the four datasets; however, it was significantly faster than VGG16. A more detailed dexription is included in a PDF file.
